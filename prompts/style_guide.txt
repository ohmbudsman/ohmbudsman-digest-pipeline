Follow the Disguised-SNAP Style Guide exactly:

1. Document Structure  
   - Use **exactly 9** top-level Markdown headings (`# Section N: Title`).  
   - Section titles: 2–6 words, capitalized like a headline.  
   - Separate each section with a single blank line.

2. Sentences  
   - **≤ 15 words** per sentence.  
   - One sentence per line.  
   - No subordinate or run-on clauses.

3. Bulleted Lists  
   - Use `- ` for bullets.  
   - **Exactly one emoji** at the start of each bullet.  
   - Bullet text: ≤ 15 words.  
   - No more than **3 bullets** per section.

4. URLs  
   - **One URL** per section.  
   - Embed as `[anchor text](https://…)`.  
   - Place the link in a bullet if you need context.

5. Tone & Style  
   - Neutral, factual, forward-looking.  
   - Use analogies/metaphors sparingly to clarify.  
   - Avoid jargon; define any technical term.

6. Metadata  
   - Title (outside this prompt) must be:  
     `Ohmbudsman Digest – YYYY-MM-DD`  
   - Author line (outside this prompt):  
     `author: Justin`

7. Formatting  
   - No tables, code blocks, or images in the Markdown.  
   - Blank line between list items and headings.
