## üöÄ Automated Digest Pipeline

New markdown files placed in `digests/` trigger the GitHub Actions workflow `automation.yml` which runs the following scripts located under `scripts/`:

| Script | Purpose |
| ------ | ------- |
| `generate_pdf.py` | Convert the digest markdown to a styled PDF saved in `outputs/pdfs/` |
| `create_social_snippets.py` | Produce social media highlights saved as JSON in `outputs/social/` |
| `generate_podcast.py` | Compress the digest into a 500‚Äì700 word podcast script |
| `synthesize_audio.py` | Generate an MP3 narration from the script and save to `outputs/podcasts/` |
| `update_metadata.py` | Append a record to `metadata/content_index.csv` |
| `archive_assets.py` | Zip assets and upload to HuggingFace for archival |

The workflow requires the following repository secrets:
`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `TRANSISTOR_API_KEY`, and `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN`.

All generated assets are committed back to the repository and attached to a GitHub Release tagged with the digest name.
